Read this for more on activations: https://keras.io/activations/\n",

The purpose of an activation function is to convert a node of input to an output signal. This output signal will now be used as input in the next layer. One common type is sigmoid: S-shaped range of 0 to 1. Another is tanh: Range of -1 to 1. Suffers from vanishing gradient problem. A POPULAR ONE is ReLu: Avoids vanishing gradient problem. Should be used within hidden layers. \n",

    "# Compilation\n",
    "### Before traning a model, we must compile the model by configuring the optimization process. We use .compile() and pass in 3 arguments: optimizer function type, loss function we are trying to minimize with our model, (optional) list of metrics to calculate. (The specified metrics are returned in a list after evaluation).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning rate is essentially how quickly a model abandons old beliefs for new ones. It is also how fast the weights change. For example, if the model sees 10 orange cats it will think all cats are orange. If it sees a black cat and has a low learning rate, it will be slow to learn that cats can also be black and will think that it is an outlier. With a very high learning rate, it will change its mind very quickly for the new data. A good learning rate is low enough that the network converges to something useful, but high enough that it doesn't take too long to train.\n",
    "#### Optimization procedures are methods that define a loss and cost function to minimize both. They are used to minimize loss in the training process. The optimization parameter specifies the type of optimizer being used. To see all the optimizer parameters and their information, check this documentation by Keras: https://keras.io/optimizers/ \n",
    "#### The loss parameter specifies how the loss is calculated. Loss is calculated on training and validation. Loss is NOT a percentage. It is the summation of the errors made for each example in the training and validation sets. Therefore, the goal of a model is to reduce the loss by changing weight values through different optimization methods. Loss value implies how well or poorly a certain model behaves after each iteration of optimization. Ideally, one would expect the reduction of loss after each, or several, iteration(s). The accuracy of a model is usually determined after the model parameters are learned and fixed and no learning is taking place. It is done by dividing correctly classified samples by all samples.  For more about loss, check this SO question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34518656/how-to-interpret-loss-and-accuracy-for-a-machine-learning-model For the TYPES of loss functions, check this KERAS DOCUMENTATION: https://keras.io/losses/\n",
    "#### metrics: List of metrics to be evaluated by the model during training and testing. Typically you will use metrics=['accuracy']. To specify different metrics for different outputs of a multi-output model, you could also pass a dictionary, such as metrics={'output_a': 'accuracy'}. \n"

What it does is whatever the batch size is, it takes that number of rows from the data and trains the model on that. Then, it goes to the next batch of that size and trains it. Small batch sizes are good because the neural network gets to update the weights after running each batch. It also requires less memory and trains faster. Disadvantage is that the gradient estimate will be less accurate.  The gradient is an optimization procedure that refers to calculating the derivative from all training data before calculating an update.
